# SESSION 32 CONTINUATION PROMPT - POST-REGRESSION FIX
**Generated**: August 9, 2025  
**Project**: O'Neill Terrain Generator  
**Current Phase**: Session 31 Complete + Regression Fixed  
**Priority**: HIGH - System Fully Functional, Ready for Enhancement

---

## üéØ **SESSION 32 STARTING CONTEXT**

**CURRENT STATUS**: ‚úÖ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL WITH REGRESSION FIXED**

Session 31 successfully achieved canvas-driven geometry node integration, and a critical regression was identified and fixed during the session. The system now provides complete paint-to-3D workflow with both UV-Canvas displacement and geometry node biomes working harmoniously.

---

## üîß **RECENT REGRESSION FIX COMPLETED**

### **Issue Identified**:
User reported seeing "object-level displacement" instead of proper UV-Canvas spatial mapping.

### **Root Cause**:
Enhanced spatial mapping system was adding conflicting `Unified_` displacement modifiers alongside UV-Canvas system, causing interference.

### **Fix Applied**:
Added conflict removal code to prevent enhanced spatial mapping from interfering with UV-Canvas displacement:

```python
# SESSION 31 REGRESSION FIX: Remove conflicting Unified_ modifiers
for obj in flat_objects:
    for mod in list(obj.modifiers):
        if mod.name.startswith("Unified_") and mod.type == 'DISPLACE':
            obj.modifiers.remove(mod)
```

### **Current Clean Architecture**:
- ‚úÖ **Canvas_Displacement**: UV-based terrain height (no conflicts)
- ‚úÖ **S31_Geometry**: Biome characteristics via geometry nodes
- ‚ùå **Unified_ modifiers**: Automatically removed if they interfere

---

## üìä **SYSTEM STATUS - FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

### **‚úÖ WORKING PERFECTLY**:
- **UV-Canvas Displacement**: Spatial mapping accuracy restored
- **Session 31 Geometry Nodes**: Canvas-driven biome characteristics working
- **Paint Detection**: Complete workflow from canvas to 3D terrain
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic removal of interfering modifiers
- **Dual System Integration**: Both displacement and geometry nodes from canvas

### **üèóÔ∏è VALIDATED ARCHITECTURE**:

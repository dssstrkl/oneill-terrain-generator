## 🎯 **SESSION 10 IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES**

### **PRIMARY GOAL: Biome Geometry Nodes Integration**
1. **Locate and test existing biome geometry nodes** - Check for canyon, hills, mountains nodes
2. **Replace basic displacement with geometry nodes** - Enhanced terrain generation
3. **Integrate with unified canvas system** - Canvas-driven geometry node parameters
4. **Test biome-specific features** - Different nodes for different painted biome colors
5. **Validate enhanced 3D terrain** - Complex terrain features from simple canvas painting

### **SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- ✅ Biome geometry nodes located and functional
- ✅ Nodes respond to unified canvas biome regions
- ✅ Enhanced terrain features visible (not just simple displacement)
- ✅ Different biomes produce distinct terrain characteristics
- ✅ System remains performant with advanced geometry

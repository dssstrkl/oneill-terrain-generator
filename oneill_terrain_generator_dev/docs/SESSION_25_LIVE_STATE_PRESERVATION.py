SESSION 25 LIVE STATE PRESERVATION FILE
=====================================
Date: August 3, 2025
Status: FUNCTIONAL UV-CANVAS INTEGRATION CONFIRMED
Purpose: Preserve working live session state for script integration

LIVE SESSION ANALYSIS RESULTS:
✅ 12 flat objects with Canvas_Displacement + Terrain_Subdivision modifiers
✅ Canvas 'oneill_terrain_canvas' (2400x628) exists and functional  
✅ Canvas_Image_Texture linked to canvas for displacement
✅ Sequential UV mapping: 0.000-0.083, 0.083-0.167, 0.167-0.250, etc.
✅ All displacement modifiers using UV coordinates with strength 1.0
✅ Painting mode active, current biome: MOUNTAINS
✅ Complete paint-to-3D workflow operational

PRESERVED FUNCTIONALITY TO INTEGRATE:
- UVCanvasIntegrationSystem class (already in main script from Session 24)
- ONEILL_OT_SetupUVCanvasIntegration operator (already in main script)
- Sequential UV mapping with proper 0.0833 step calculation
- Canvas_Displacement modifiers with UV texture coordinates
- Terrain_Subdivision modifiers for smooth displacement

INTEGRATION STATUS:
The Session 24 UV-Canvas integration code in main_terrain_system.py appears to be 
complete and matches the live session state. The live session confirms:

1. Canvas exists: oneill_terrain_canvas (2400x628)
2. Canvas_Image_Texture exists and linked to canvas  
3. All 12 flat objects have proper modifier stack
4. Sequential UV mapping functional across all objects
5. Paint-to-3D workflow working correctly

CONCLUSION:
The live session state matches the Session 24 preserved code in main_terrain_system.py.
The UVCanvasIntegrationSystem.implement_complete_uv_canvas_system() method has been
successfully applied and is working as designed.

NO ADDITIONAL SCRIPT CHANGES REQUIRED - Session 24 preservation was complete and accurate.

# VERIFICATION CODE FOR LIVE SESSION STATE
"""
Live session verification commands used:

# Check flat objects
flat_objects = [obj for obj in bpy.data.objects if obj.get("oneill_flat")]
print(f"Found {len(flat_objects)} flat objects")

# Check canvas
canvas = bpy.data.images['oneill_terrain_canvas']  
print(f"Canvas: {canvas.size[0]}x{canvas.size[1]}")

# Check Canvas_Image_Texture
texture = bpy.data.textures['Canvas_Image_Texture']
print(f"Texture linked to: {texture.image.name}")

# Check modifiers on each object
for obj in flat_objects:
    for mod in obj.modifiers:
        if mod.type == 'DISPLACE':
            print(f"{obj.name}: {mod.name}, coords={mod.texture_coords}, strength={mod.strength}")

# Check UV mapping samples
for obj in flat_objects:
    if obj.data.uv_layers:
        uv_layer = obj.data.uv_layers.active.data
        sample_uvs = [(uv.uv[0], uv.uv[1]) for uv in list(uv_layer)[:5]]
        print(f"{obj.name} UV range: {min(uv[0] for uv in sample_uvs):.3f}-{max(uv[0] for uv in sample_uvs):.3f}")

RESULTS CONFIRMED:
✅ Sequential UV mapping: 0.000-0.083, 0.083-0.167, 0.167-0.250, 0.250-0.333, 
   0.333-0.417, 0.417-0.500, 0.500-0.583, 0.583-0.667, 0.667-0.750, 0.750-0.833, 
   0.833-0.917, 0.917-1.000
✅ All Canvas_Displacement modifiers using UV texture coordinates  
✅ Canvas_Image_Texture properly linked to oneill_terrain_canvas
✅ Paint-to-3D workflow functional and validated

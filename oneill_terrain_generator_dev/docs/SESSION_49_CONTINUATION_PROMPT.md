SESSION 49 CONTINUATION - AUTO-PREVIEW REGISTRATION FIX
**Generated**: August 15, 2025 **Project**: O'Neill Terrain Generator **Status**: üîß **REGISTRATION FIX NEEDED** **Objective**: Complete auto-preview activation by fixing operator registration

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SESSION MANAGEMENT**
**EFFICIENCY MANDATE**: Session 48 achieved infrastructure success. Session 49 needs focused registration fix. **STAY ON TASK OR SESSION FAILS.**

**STRICT PROTOCOL:**
* ‚úÖ **REGISTRATION FIX ONLY** - Resolve paint detection operator availability
* ‚úÖ **ASK FOR GUIDANCE** if approach doesn't work as expected  
* ‚úÖ **STOP IMMEDIATELY** if encountering unexpected issues
* ‚úÖ **NO SCOPE CREEP** beyond registration fix

üéØ **SESSION 48 SUCCESS SUMMARY**
**MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS COMPLETED:**
* ‚úÖ **Auto-preview infrastructure** implemented in StartTerrainPainting operator
* ‚úÖ **Paint detection operator** integrated from proven Session 23 working version
* ‚úÖ **Canvas-to-UV mapping** complete spatial mapping system included
* ‚úÖ **Registration structure** operator added to classes list correctly

**CURRENT STATUS:**
* **Paint Mode**: ‚úÖ Working perfectly (split screen, biome selection, canvas)
* **Auto-preview Call**: ‚úÖ Logic implemented and executing
* **Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ Complete and ready for activation
* **Missing**: Operator registration completing successfully

üö® **SESSION 49 SPECIFIC ISSUE**
**USER PROBLEM**: Auto-preview infrastructure calls paint detection but operator not available

**TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:**
* StartTerrainPainting successfully calls `detect_paint_apply_previews`
* Paint detection operator code is correct (copied from working Session 23)
* Operator added to classes list properly
* **ISSUE**: Registration not completing - operator not available via bpy.ops

**ROOT CAUSE**: Minor registration timing or import issue preventing operator availability

üéØ **SESSION 49 OBJECTIVE**
**PRIMARY GOAL**: Fix operator registration to complete auto-preview functionality

**SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT**: Ensure `bpy.ops.oneill.detect_paint_apply_previews` is available after script reload

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
* `detect_paint_apply_previews` operator available in bpy.ops.oneill
* StartTerrainPainting successfully calls paint detection automatically
* Paint on canvas ‚Üí immediate 3D terrain updates
* Complete seamless paint-to-3D workflow functional

üîß **SESSION 49 TECHNICAL APPROACH**

**PHASE 1: Diagnose Registration Issue (10 minutes)**
1. **Check operator class definition** for syntax or import issues
2. **Verify registration sequence** and dependencies  
3. **Test manual registration** to isolate problem
4. **Identify specific failure point** in registration process

**PHASE 2: Fix Registration (15 minutes)**  
1. **Resolve import/syntax issues** if found
2. **Fix registration sequence** if needed
3. **Ensure proper class availability** during registration
4. **Test operator accessibility** after fixes

**PHASE 3: Validate Complete Workflow (15 minutes)**
1. **Test StartTerrainPainting** with auto-preview
2. **Verify paint detection** executes successfully  
3. **Confirm paint-to-3D workflow** works end-to-end
4. **Document successful completion**

üìÅ **CURRENT FILE STATUS**
**Main Script**: `/Users/dssstrkl/Documents/Projects/oneill terrain generator/oneill_terrain_generator_dev/main_terrain_system.py`

**CONTAINS (from Session 48)**:
* ‚úÖ Enhanced StartTerrainPainting with auto-preview call
* ‚úÖ Complete ONEILL_OT_DetectPaintApplyPreviews operator (130+ lines)
* ‚úÖ Paint detection added to classes list for registration
* ‚úÖ Canvas-to-UV mapping and biome detection algorithms

**NEEDS FIX**:
* Registration completion for paint detection operator
* Operator availability via bpy.ops.oneill.detect_paint_apply_previews

üéØ **SESSION 49 FOCUS AREAS**

**DO:**
* Fix registration issue for paint detection operator
* Test manual registration to isolate problem
* Verify operator availability after fixes
* Validate complete auto-preview workflow

**DON'T:**
* Rebuild or modify existing working functionality  
* Change Session 48 infrastructure (already correct)
* Add new features beyond registration fix
* Modify paint detection operator code (proven working)

**IF PROBLEMS OCCUR:**
* **STOP IMMEDIATELY** and ask for guidance
* **DON'T TROUBLESHOOT** complex issues independently  
* **FOCUS ON** the specific registration fix task

üéØ **EXPECTED SESSION 49 OUTCOME**
**After successful completion:**
* `bpy.ops.oneill.detect_paint_apply_previews` available and functional
* StartTerrainPainting automatically activates paint detection  
* Paint on canvas ‚Üí immediate 3D terrain updates visible
* Complete seamless paint-to-3D workflow operational

**USER EXPERIENCE COMPLETION:**
* **BEFORE**: Paint mode works but auto-preview fails due to registration
* **AFTER**: Paint mode automatically starts preview - paint and see results immediately

**üéØ SESSION 49 MISSION: FIX OPERATOR REGISTRATION TO COMPLETE AUTO-PREVIEW FUNCTIONALITY**

*This session completes Session 48's infrastructure success with the final registration fix for seamless paint-to-3D workflow.*

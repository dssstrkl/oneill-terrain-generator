## 🎯 **PROBLEM SOLVED**

### **Key Changes Made:**

**1. Start Terrain Painting Auto-Activation:**

preview_system = GlobalPreviewDisplacementSystem()
if preview_system.apply_unified_system_to_objects(flat_objects):
    print("✅ Auto-activated unified terrain preview")
```

**2. UI Updates:**
- Changed label: "🎨 Painting Mode Active (Auto-Preview ON)"
- Manual button now: "🔄 Refresh Preview (Optional)"
- Added info: "ℹ️ Preview activates automatically when painting starts"

**3. User Experience:**
- ✅ **Start painting** → **Terrain automatically ready**

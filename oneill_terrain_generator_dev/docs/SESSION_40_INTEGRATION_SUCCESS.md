## 🔧 **MINIMAL FUNCTIONAL CHANGES IMPLEMENTED**

**Approach**: Surgical updates to preserve existing working code while integrating unified system.

### **1. GlobalPreviewDisplacementSystem Updates**
```python
# ADDED: Unified system creation function
def create_unified_multi_biome_system(self):
    """SESSION 40: Create unified node group exactly as working scene"""
    # Creates Unified_Multi_Biome_Terrain.001 with exact working structure
    # Includes proper node connections and canvas image linking

# ADDED: Unified system application function  
def apply_unified_system_to_objects(self, objects):
    """SESSION 40: Apply unified system to objects - SINGLE MODIFIER ONLY"""
    # Removes conflicting modifiers, applies unified approach

# UPDATED: Biome preview to prefer unified system
def create_biome_preview(self, obj, biome_name):
    """SESSION 40 UNIFIED: Use unified system instead of per-object approach"""
    # Checks for unified system first, uses fallback only if needed
```

### **2. DetectPaintApplyPreviews Operator Updates**
```python
# UPDATED: Apply unified system to all objects at once
def execute(self, context):
    # SESSION 40: Apply unified system to all objects at once
    if preview_system.apply_unified_system_to_objects(flat_objects):
        # Success path - unified system applied
    else:
        # Fallback path - per-object detection if needed
```

### **3. UVCanvasIntegrationSystem Updates**
```python
# UPDATED: Include unified system in UV-Canvas integration
def implement_complete_uv_canvas_system(self):
    # Step 4: SESSION 40 - Apply unified multi-biome system
    preview_system = GlobalPreviewDisplacementSystem()
    if preview_system.apply_unified_system_to_objects(flat_objects):
        print("✅ Unified multi-biome system applied successfully")
```

## 🎯 **UNIFIED NODE GROUP STRUCTURE INTEGRATED**

**Node Group**: `Unified_Multi_Biome_Terrain.001`

**Exact Working Structure Preserved:**
```
Group Input → Geometry Input

UV System:
├── Named Attribute ("UVMap") → UV coordinates
└── Image Texture (Unified_Canvas_Sampler) → Canvas sampling
    └── Image: oneill_terrain_canvas (2400×628)

Canvas Analysis:
├── Separate XYZ → Extract RGB channels  
├── Color Ramp → Blue channel detection
│   ├── Position 0.0: Black (0,0,0,1) → No terrain
│   └── Position 0.5: White (1,1,1,1) → Full terrain
└── Output: Terrain intensity mask

Terrain Generation:
├── Input Position → Vertex world coordinates
├── Noise Texture → Sophisticated terrain patterns
│   ├── Scale: 5.0
│   ├── Detail: 10.0
│   └── Vector: Position coordinates
└── Math Multiply → Combine noise with canvas mask

Final Output:
├── Combine XYZ → Z-offset from terrain intensity
├── Set Position → Apply displacement to geometry
└── Group Output → Final terrain geometry
```

**Essential Node Connections Added:**
- UV flow: Named Attribute → Canvas Sampler
- Color analysis: Canvas → Separate XYZ → Color Ramp  
- Terrain generation: Position → Noise → Math
- Final output: Math → Combine XYZ → Set Position

## üöÄ **PHASE 1.2 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Core Objective**: 
Create unified canvas that represents all 12 cylinder objects as single paintable surface while preserving individual objects for LOD export.

### **Technical Architecture**:

**Current System (Phase 1.1)**:
```
Individual Canvas per Region ‚Üí Paint per Region ‚Üí Apply to Individual Objects
Issues: Canvas regions don't map predictably to 3D cylinder areas
```

**Target System (Phase 1.2)**:
```
Unified Canvas ‚Üí UV Mapping ‚Üí All Cylinders Represented ‚Üí Individual Object Export
Benefits: Precise pixel-to-3D correspondence, unified painting experience
```

### **Implementation Steps**:

#### **Step 1: Flat Object Layout Analysis**
- **Goal**: Calculate positions and dimensions of all 12 flat objects
- **Technical**: Analyze `obj.location`, `obj.dimensions` for each flat object
- **Output**: Layout bounds (min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y) and object positioning table

#### **Step 2: Unified Canvas Dimension Calculation**
- **Goal**: Determine optimal canvas size to represent all objects
- **Technical**: Calculate based on layout bounds with appropriate pixels-per-unit ratio
- **Output**: Single canvas dimensions (e.g., 4096x2048) that encompasses all flat objects

#### **Step 3: UV Mapping Correspondence Table**
- **Goal**: Create pixel-to-object mapping system
- **Technical**: Calculate which canvas pixels correspond to which cylinder object
- **Output**: UV mapping table for precise spatial correspondence

#### **Step 4: Unified Canvas Creation**
- **Goal**: Replace current individual region approach with single canvas
- **Technical**: Modify `CanvasManager.recreate_canvas_with_proper_dimensions()`
- **Output**: Single `ONeill_Unified_Canvas` that represents all cylinders

#### **Step 5: Region Detection Update**
- **Goal**: Update spatial mapping to work with unified canvas
- **Technical**: Modify `SimplifiedSpatialMapping` to use UV correspondence
- **Output**: Enhanced region detection that maps canvas areas to specific objects

### **Backward Compatibility Requirements**:
- Maintain existing flat object structure during transition
- Preserve current biome selector functionality
- Keep enhanced spatial mapping working during development
- Ensure user can continue using system during implementation

    - get_pixel_region_for_object()       # Object ‚Üí Pixel region lookup
    - validate_correspondence()           # Test mapping accuracy
```

#### **LayoutAnalyzer**:
```python
class LayoutAnalyzer:
    - get_flat_object_bounds()         # Calculate object positions
    - optimize_canvas_layout()         # Arrange for efficiency

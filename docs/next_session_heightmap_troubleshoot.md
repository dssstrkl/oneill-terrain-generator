# NEXT SESSION: Heightmap Generation Troubleshooting

## ðŸŽ¯ **SPECIFIC ISSUE TO RESOLVE**

### **Problem Statement:**
The "Create Heightmaps" function (Step 3) is not working as expected in the v2.2.0 build.

### **Context:**
- v2.2.0 Grid Overlay integration is COMPLETE and working
- All other workflow steps (1,2,4,5,6) are functional
- Need targeted fix for heightmap generation only

### **Troubleshooting Approach:**
1. **Test the current heightmap function** with existing cylinder scene
2. **Identify specific failure mode** (no images created? wrong properties? UI issue?)
3. **Check against working implementation** in project knowledge/previous builds
4. **Apply minimal fix** to restore functionality
5. **Verify heightmap creation enables painting workflow**

### **Success Criteria:**
- Create Heightmaps button creates proper heightmap images
- Images appear in Image Editor for painting
- Heightmaps have correct resolution and properties
- Enables transition to Step 4 (Paint Terrain Biomes)

### **CRITICAL: Use Working Code Foundation**
- Start with current v2.2.0 as base (it's 95% working)
- Reference working heightmap implementations in project knowledge
- Make minimal targeted fix only
- Don't refactor working parts of the system

### **Available Resources:**
- Current scene with aligned cylinders and flat objects
- Project knowledge with working heightmap implementations
- v2.2.0 build with grid overlay working correctly
- All supporting documentation and previous builds

**GOAL: Get Step 3 working with minimal changes to restore complete workflow functionality**

## Workflow Documentation Update - Append to docs/workflow.md

### Development Branch Workflow - Updated June 21, 2025

#### **Daily Development Workflow - Enhanced**

##### **Development Environment Setup**
```bash
cd "/Users/dssstrkl/Documents/Projects/oneill terrain generator"

# Create feature branch for new development
git checkout -b feature/modular-geometry-nodes

# Development files are in src/dev/
# Stable files remain in src/
```

##### **Development File Structure**
```
oneill terrain generator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ oneill_heightmap_terrain.py          # ‚Üê STABLE VERSION (production)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ oneill_heightmap_terrain_dev.py  # ‚Üê DEVELOPMENT VERSION (testing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore                               # ‚Üê Updated for dev files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [rest of project]
```

##### **Development Version Features**
- **Clear Identification**: Add-on name shows "[DEV]" suffix
- **Visual Warnings**: Red alert box in UI showing development status
- **Console Logging**: Enhanced registration messages with file path info
- **Debug Information**: UI shows version, branch, and asset system status

##### **Making Changes - Enhanced Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Work in development version
# Edit: src/dev/oneill_heightmap_terrain_dev.py

# 2. Test in Blender
# Install from: /Users/dssstrkl/Documents/Projects/oneill terrain generator/src/dev/oneill_heightmap_terrain_dev.py

# 3. Commit development changes
git add src/dev/oneill_heightmap_terrain_dev.py
git commit -m "dev: test unified heightmap system"

# 4. When stable, promote to main version
cp src/dev/oneill_heightmap_terrain_dev.py src/oneill_heightmap_terrain.py
git add src/oneill_heightmap_terrain.py
git commit -m "feat: v2.1 - unified heightmap system"

# 5. Push and merge
git push origin feature/modular-geometry-nodes
```

#### **Version Control Best Practices - Updated**

##### **Branch Strategy**
- **main**: Stable, production-ready versions only
- **feature/[name]**: Development branches for new features
- **src/dev/**: Development files that can be safely modified

##### **File Safety Rules**
- ‚úÖ **Safe to modify**: `src/dev/oneill_heightmap_terrain_dev.py`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Careful with**: `src/oneill_heightmap_terrain.py` (stable version)
- ‚úÖ **Test with**: Any .blend files in examples/

##### **Development Indicators**
When working with development version, you'll see:
- **Blender Add-on Name**: "O'Neill Cylinder Heightmap Terrain [DEV]"
- **UI Warning**: Red alert box showing "üöß DEVELOPMENT VERSION v2.0"
- **Console Messages**: "üöß This is a DEVELOPMENT version for testing"
- **Debug Info**: Version, branch, and asset system status in UI

##### **Testing Workflow**
```bash
# Always test development version first
1. Install src/dev/oneill_heightmap_terrain_dev.py in Blender
2. Verify red development warning appears in UI
3. Test new features thoroughly
4. Commit development changes with "dev:" prefix
5. Only promote to stable when thoroughly tested
```

#### **Safety Features**
- **Visual Separation**: Impossible to confuse dev vs stable versions
- **Console Warnings**: Clear development status during registration
- **File Structure**: Clean separation prevents accidental overwrites
- **Git Workflow**: Feature branches protect main branch stability

This enhanced workflow ensures safe development while maintaining a stable production version.

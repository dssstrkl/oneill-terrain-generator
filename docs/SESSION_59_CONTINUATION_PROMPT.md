## ðŸŽ¨ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**

### **Natural Stroke Wrapping Algorithm:**

```python
class NaturalStrokeWrapper:
    def __init__(self, canvas):
        self.canvas = canvas
        self.active_strokes = {}
        self.boundary_threshold = 5  # pixels from edge
        
    def monitor_stroke_boundaries(self):
        """Real-time stroke boundary detection"""
        # Detect paint events near Y-axis boundaries
        # Track stroke direction and velocity
        # Trigger wrapping when crossing detected
        
    def wrap_stroke_continuation(self, stroke_data):
        """Continue stroke on opposite Y-axis edge"""
        # Calculate opposite edge position
        # Place stroke continuation with same properties
        # Ensure seamless visual flow
        
    def update_terrain_uv(self):
        """Coordinate UV mapping for seamless wrapping"""
        # Use full 0.0-1.0 UV range
        # Let geometry node REPEAT handle wrapping
        # Ensure 100% canvas utilization
```

3. **Long Strokes**: Extended strokes that cross multiple times
4. **Various Brushes**: Different brush sizes, colors, and properties
5. **Terrain Verification**: Wrapped canvas creates seamless cylindrical terrain

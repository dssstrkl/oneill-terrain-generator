# Two-Stage Preview → Lock-In Terrain System

## 🎯 System Overview

The optimal solution for real-time terrain painting combines **fast previews during painting** with **high-quality lock-in when finishing**. This two-stage approach provides immediate visual feedback without performance penalties, then converts previews to final terrain when the user explicitly commits.

## 📋 Current Problem Analysis

### **Issues with Current Implementation**
- **Performance vs Quality Conflict**: Can't have both fast updates AND high-quality terrain
- **All-or-Nothing Approach**: Either laggy real-time updates OR no visual feedback
- **User Uncertainty**: No way to see what you're painting without heavy processing
- **Workflow Interruption**: Heavy operations happen during creative painting process

### **Root Cause**
Attempting to apply full-quality heightmap-based geometry nodes in real-time is too computationally expensive for smooth painting workflow.

## 💡 Two-Stage Solution Design

### **Stage 1: Preview Mode (During Painting)**
- **Purpose**: Provide immediate visual feedback for paint strokes
- **Performance**: Ultra-lightweight (no lag)
- **Quality**: Basic displacement hints (enough to see "something is there")
- **Frequency**: 2-3 FPS updates for responsiveness
- **Method**: Simple displacement modifiers with basic noise textures

### **Stage 2: Lock-In Mode (Finish Painting)**
- **Purpose**: Convert previews to final, high-quality terrain
- **Performance**: One-time heavy operation (user expects brief delay)
- **Quality**: Full heightmap-based geometry nodes with biome-specific features
- **Trigger**: User clicks "Finish Terrain Painting" button
- **Method**: Canvas analysis, heightmap transfer, geometry node application

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### **Complete Workflow**
```
1. Start Terrain Painting
   ├── Real-time monitoring: ON (lightweight)
   ├── Preview mode: ACTIVE
   └── Visual feedback: Basic displacement hints

2. Paint Session
   ├── Paint mountains (gray) → See mountain-like bumps immediately
   ├── Paint ocean (blue) → See depression hints immediately  
   ├── Paint hills (green) → See rolling displacement hints
   └── All updates happen smoothly (no lag)

3. Finish Terrain Painting ← CONVERSION TRIGGER
   ├── Real-time monitoring: STOPS
   ├── Canvas analysis: STARTS
   ├── Progress display: "Processing object 1 of 12..."
   ├── Heightmap transfer: Canvas regions → Individual heightmaps
   ├── Geometry nodes: Apply biome-specific terrain generators
   └── Result: High-quality terrain ready for next workflow step

4. Final State
   ├── Preview modifiers: REMOVED
   ├── Final terrain: APPLIED (heightmap-based)
   ├── Performance: OPTIMAL (no real-time processing)
   └── Ready for: Rewrap to cylinders
```

### **Visual Feedback Progression**
- **Start**: Flat objects visible
- **During Painting**: Colored displacement hints appear as you paint
- **Finish Processing**: Brief "Converting previews..." progress
- **Final Result**: Detailed terrain matching painted areas exactly

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Stage | Frequency | Quality | Performance Impact | User Control |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Preview** | 2-3 FPS | Basic hints | Minimal (no lag) | Continuous |
| **Lock-In** | One-time | Full quality | Heavy (brief delay) | User-triggered |
| **Final** | Static | Production ready | None | Complete control |

## 🛠️ Implementation Requirements

### **Preview System Requirements**
1. **Lightweight Displacement Modifiers**
   - Use traditional Blender displacement (not geometry nodes)
   - Simple noise textures with biome-specific parameters
   - Quick application/removal for real-time updates

2. **Biome-Coded Visual Hints**
   - Mountains: Tall, rough displacement
   - Ocean: Negative displacement (depressions)
   - Hills: Gentle, rolling displacement
   - Canyons: Sharp, directional displacement
   - Desert: Low, sandy displacement
   - Archipelago: Mixed positive/negative displacement

3. **Performance Safeguards**
   - Maximum 3 FPS update frequency
   - Emergency stop if lag detected
   - Automatic fallback to manual mode if hardware insufficient

### **Lock-In System Requirements**
1. **Canvas Analysis Engine**
   - Scan entire canvas for painted regions
   - Identify biome colors and coverage areas
   - Map canvas coordinates to flat objects
   - Generate processing queue (object → biome mappings)

2. **Heightmap Transfer System**
   - Extract painted canvas regions
   - Resize/resample to match individual heightmap dimensions
   - Update individual object heightmaps with painted data
   - Preserve paint intensity as height values

3. **Geometry Node Application**
   - Remove all preview modifiers
   - Apply proper biome geometry nodes
   - Connect heightmap images as displacement sources
   - Set biome-specific parameters (strength, scale, etc.)

4. **Progress Reporting**
   - Show processing progress to user
   - Report which biomes applied to which objects
   - Provide error handling for failed applications
   - Display completion summary

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### **Preview Stage Success**
- ✅ **Responsive Painting**: No lag during brush strokes
- ✅ **Immediate Feedback**: Visual hints appear within 0.5 seconds

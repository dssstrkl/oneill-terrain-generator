# O'Neill Terrain Generator - Conversation Starter

## Quick Context for AI Assistants:
- **Project Goal**: Blender add-on for O'Neill cylinder interior terrain using heightmap workflow
- **Current Status**: Fully functional 6-step workflow with minor issues
- **Last Updated**: June 21, 2025
- **Working Version**: `src/oneill_heightmap_terrain.py`

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST:
1. **NEVER start from scratch** - always use existing working code
2. **Check `src/assets/`** for working geometry nodes and presets
3. **Fix specific issues only** - don't rebuild working systems
4. **Read this entire document** before any development
5. **Use working assets** from project folder instead of creating new

## Current Workflow State:
✅ **Working**: Complete 5-step workflow with terrain painting integration
✅ **NEW**: Manual biome painting system (Mountains, Canyons, Hills, Desert, Ocean)
⚠️ **Minor Issue**: Grid overlay controls present but lines not visible in Image Editor
⚠️ **Missing**: Archipelago biome needs addition to BIOME_TYPES

## Recent Major Achievement:
✅ **TERRAIN PAINTING SYSTEM DEPLOYED**: Version 2.2.0 breakthrough
- Complete manual biome control with 5 terrain types
- Professional UI with emoji-based biome selection (🏔️🏜️🏞️🌵🌊)
- Automatic Image Editor + 3D View layout for painting workflow
- Grid overlay framework with precision controls (rendering needs fix)
- Ready for professional game development terrain design

## Enhanced Workflow (v2.2.0):
1. ✅ **Align Cylinders** - Vertex-level precision alignment
2. ✅ **Unwrap to Flat** - Surface area preserving unwrap
3. ✅ **Create Heightmaps** - Raster image generation  
4. ✅ **Paint Terrain Biomes** - NEW! Manual biome painting system
5. ✅ **Rewrap to Cylinders** - Apply painted terrain to geometry

## Working Assets to Use (ALWAYS CHECK THESE FIRST):
- `src/assets/geometry_nodes/` - Proven terrain displacement nodes
- `src/assets/presets/` - Working configuration presets  
- `src/previous/` - Previous working versions
- `docs/archipelago_generator_guide.md` - Implementation reference
- `src/oneill_heightmap_terrain.py` - Current main implementation

## Key Project Context:
- **Worldbuilding**: dssstrkl alien civilization fleeing in O'Neill cylinder space ark
- **Technology**: Atlantean 4D tesseract power, bone-stone materials, antigravity
- **Game Pipeline**: Blender terrain generation → Unreal Engine integration
- **Workflow**: Heightmap-based like True Terrain, preserves original geometry exactly

## Development History Summary:
- ✅ **Resolved**: UI visibility issues, geometry nodes socket errors, heightmap workflow
- ✅ **Working**: Complete 6-step terrain generation pipeline
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Visual progress indicators, real-time scale controls
- ❌ **Current Issues**: Terrain visibility and UI button missing

## Next Steps (Critical Fixes):
1. **DEBUG GRID OVERLAY** - Fix rendering so grid lines appear in Image Editor
2. **ADD ARCHIPELAGO BIOME** - Include 🏝️ Archipelago in BIOME_TYPES constant  
3. **VALIDATE WORKFLOW** - Test complete end-to-end painting to rewrap process
4. **PERFORMANCE TEST** - Verify system stability with multiple cylinder objects

## Reference for Next Session:
- `docs/grid_integration_troubleshooting.md` - Grid overlay technical details
- `docs/development_summary.txt` - Complete biome system specifications
- `src/previous/` - Working grid implementations for reference
- Current artifact: Complete terrain painting system ready for fixes

## Critical Lesson Learned:
**DO NOT create geometry nodes from scratch** - we lost working terrain displacement by rebuilding instead of using proven assets from `src/assets/geometry_nodes/`. Always import and adapt existing working components.

## For Full Context, Read:
- `docs/project_overview.md` - Complete project vision and goals
- `docs/development_summary.txt` - Technical implementation history  
- `docs/current_status.md` - Detailed status of known issues
- `docs/assets_guide.md` - Guide to using existing working components

## Quick Start for AI Assistants:
1. Read this document completely
2. Check `docs/current_status.md` for latest issue details
3. Review `src/assets/` for working components to use
4. Only fix specific issues - don't rebuild working systems
5. Update documentation when issues are resolved

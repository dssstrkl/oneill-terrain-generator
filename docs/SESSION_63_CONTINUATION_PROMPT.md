## ðŸ”§ **IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION**

### **CORE SYSTEM: Stroke-Based Y-Wrapping**

**Concept**: Monitor user brush strokes near Y-boundaries and automatically paint mirrored strokes on opposite edges to simulate cylindrical surface wrapping.

#### **1. Canvas Monitoring Module**
```python
IMPLEMENTATION TARGET: Real-time stroke detection
â”œâ”€â”€ Monitor: bpy.data.images["oneill_terrain_canvas"].pixels every 100ms
â”œâ”€â”€ Detect: Pixel changes within brush_radius of Y-edges (top/bottom)
â”œâ”€â”€ Extract: Brush properties (size, color, opacity) from paint settings
â””â”€â”€ Identify: Active painting areas and boundary proximity
```

#### **2. Stroke Mirroring Engine**
```python
IMPLEMENTATION TARGET: Automatic wrapped stroke application
â”œâ”€â”€ Calculate: Opposite edge position mapping (topâ†”bottom)
â”œâ”€â”€ Limit: Maximum wrap distance = min(brush_radius, canvas_height * 0.15)
â”œâ”€â”€ Apply: Identical brush stroke at wrapped position
â””â”€â”€ Synchronize: Stop wrapped stroke when original stroke stops
```

#### **3. Safety and Control Systems**
```python  
IMPLEMENTATION TARGET: Robust operation with conservative limits
â”œâ”€â”€ Auto-timeout: Maximum 2-3 seconds for wrapped strokes
â”œâ”€â”€ Change detection: Stop when original stroke area stops changing
â”œâ”€â”€ Performance: Limit to 100ms monitoring intervals
â””â”€â”€ Bounds checking: Ensure wrapped strokes stay within canvas
```

## ðŸ“‹ **DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **PHASE 1: Core Monitoring System (Priority: HIGH)**

#### **Step 1: Canvas Change Detection**
```python
# Implement real-time canvas monitoring
def monitor_canvas_changes():
    canvas = bpy.data.images.get("oneill_terrain_canvas")
    # Monitor pixel changes every 100ms
    # Detect painting activity near Y-boundaries
    # Return: detected_changes, boundary_proximity, brush_info
```

#### **Step 2: Boundary Proximity Detection**  
```python
# Identify painting near Y-edges
def detect_boundary_painting(canvas_changes, brush_radius):
    # Check if painting within brush_radius of top edge (Y < brush_radius)
    # Check if painting within brush_radius of bottom edge (Y > height - brush_radius)
    # Return: is_near_boundary, boundary_type, paint_coordinates
```

#### **Step 3: Brush Property Extraction**
```python
# Get current brush settings for stroke replication
def get_brush_properties():
    paint_settings = bpy.context.scene.tool_settings.image_paint
    # Extract: brush.size, brush.color, brush.strength, brush.blend_type
    # Return: brush_properties_dict
```

### **PHASE 2: Stroke Mirroring Engine (Priority: HIGH)**

#### **Step 4: Wrap Position Calculation**
```python
# Calculate wrapped stroke position on opposite edge
def calculate_wrapped_position(original_coords, canvas_height, brush_radius):
    # For top boundary: wrapped_Y = original_Y + canvas_height  
    # For bottom boundary: wrapped_Y = original_Y - canvas_height
    # Apply conservative limit: min(brush_radius, canvas_height * 0.15)
    # Return: wrapped_coordinates, wrap_distance
```

#### **Step 5: Stroke Replication**
```python
# Apply mirrored stroke with identical properties
def apply_wrapped_stroke(wrapped_coords, brush_properties, canvas):
    # Paint at wrapped position using extracted brush properties
    # Match original stroke: color, size, opacity, blend mode
    # Apply to canvas pixel array directly
    # Return: success_status, painted_area
```

### **PHASE 3: Integration and Safety (Priority: MEDIUM)**

#### **Step 6: Synchronized Control**
```python
# Coordinate wrapped stroke with original stroke
def synchronize_wrapped_painting():
    # Start wrapped stroke when boundary painting detected
    # Continue wrapped stroke while original painting active
    # Stop wrapped stroke immediately when original stroke stops
    # Auto-timeout after 2-3 seconds maximum
```

#### **Step 7: Performance Optimization**
```python
# Ensure responsive operation without system overload
def optimize_monitoring_performance():
    # Limit monitoring to painting mode only
    # Use efficient pixel change detection algorithms
    # Minimize memory allocation during monitoring
    # Provide manual enable/disable controls
```

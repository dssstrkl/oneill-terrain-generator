# Current Project Status - Live Document

**Last Updated**: June 21, 2025  
**Current Version**: 1.1.1  
**Main File**: `src/oneill_heightmap_terrain.py`  
**Status**: Functional with minor issues

## Workflow Status:
| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1. Align Cylinders | ‚úÖ Working | Perfect alignment along chosen axis |
| 2. Unwrap to Flat | ‚úÖ Working | Creates proper flat grids with surface area preservation |
| 3. Create Heightmaps | ‚úÖ Working | Generates raster images with materials |
| 4. Setup Geometry Nodes | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Works but uses created nodes instead of project assets |
| 5. Generate Terrain | ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue | Console activity but no visible displacement |
| 6. Rewrap to Cylinders | ‚úÖ Working | Exact geometry preservation |

## Current Issues (Priority Order):

### 1. **Terrain Not Visible in Viewport** (High Priority)
- **Symptom**: Scale changes move entire object instead of creating vertex displacement
- **Root Cause**: Created geometry nodes from scratch instead of using `src/assets/geometry_nodes/`
- **Solution**: Import working node group and fix UV coordinate mapping
- **Status**: In progress - improved UV mapping approach implemented
- **Files Affected**: Geometry nodes setup in `ONEILL_OT_SetupGeometryNodes`

### 2. **Update Scale Button Missing** (Medium Priority)  
- **Symptom**: UI element not visible despite being in code
- **Root Cause**: Registration or layout issue with `ONEILL_OT_UpdateTerrainScale`
- **Investigation Needed**: Check operator in classes list, verify panel layout
- **Status**: Needs debugging
- **Files Affected**: UI panel in `ONEILL_PT_MainPanel.draw()`

## Recently Resolved Issues:

### ‚úÖ **Geometry Nodes Socket Interface Error** (Resolved)
- **Issue**: `NodeTreeInterfaceSocketImage.default_value expected a Image type, not float`
- **Solution**: Store socket references directly, only set default_value on Float sockets
- **Result**: "Setup Live Preview" button now works without errors

### ‚úÖ **UI Visibility Issues** (Resolved)  
- **Issue**: Buttons not showing, registration conflicts
- **Solution**: Custom tab category, cleanup functions, simplified panel logic
- **Result**: Complete UI with progress indicators and visual feedback

### ‚úÖ **Heightmap Update Propagation** (Resolved)
- **Issue**: Generate Terrain had no visible effect
- **Solution**: Added `image.update_tag()`, viewport refresh, material updates
- **Result**: Console shows proper activity and heightmap generation

## UI Enhancements Added:
- ‚úÖ Visual progress indicators with checkmarks and icons
- ‚úÖ Button state changes showing completion status  
- ‚úÖ Smart UI adaptation showing controls only when appropriate
- ‚úÖ Progress summary box with counts and next-step guidance
- ‚úÖ Enhanced terrain controls with scale multiplier

## Assets Available for Use:
- ‚úÖ **Working geometry nodes** in `src/assets/geometry_nodes/`
- ‚úÖ **Previous working versions** in `src/previous/`  
- ‚úÖ **Implementation guides** in `docs/archipelago_generator_guide.md`
- ‚úÖ **Proven configurations** in `src/assets/presets/`

## Performance & Compatibility:
- ‚úÖ **Blender 4.0+** compatibility confirmed
- ‚úÖ **Registration system** stable and reliable
- ‚úÖ **Memory usage** optimized for large cylinder counts
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** prevents crashes and provides helpful feedback

## Next Development Session Tasks:
1. **Import working geometry nodes** from `src/assets/geometry_nodes/` directory
2. **Test terrain visibility** with proven node setup
3. **Debug update scale button** registration and layout
4. **Validate complete workflow** with working assets
5. **Update this status document** with resolution results

## Development Notes:
- **Always use existing working assets** before creating new implementations
- **Test with actual O'Neill cylinder geometry** from user's scene
- **Preserve exact original geometry** - this is a core requirement
- **Focus on heightmap workflow** - proven approach for game development

## Version 2.0 Update - June 21, 2025

### üéâ MAJOR MILESTONE: Modular Geometry Nodes Integration

#### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED IN v2.0:**

**Modular Asset System:**
- GeometryNodesAssetManager successfully implemented
- Assets automatically discovered from `src/assets/geometry_nodes/`
- Working import from existing `archipelago_terrain_generator.blend`
- Project-aware path detection works from any .blend file in project

**UI/UX Improvements:**
- Visual workflow indicators with ‚úÖ checkmarks and blue buttons
- Undo functionality for rewrap operations (ONEILL_OT_UndoRewrap)
- Asset status display shows available geometry node assets
- Enhanced workflow clarity with completion status

**Technical Integration:**
- Successfully imports and applies geometry nodes from project assets
- Live preview system works with modular node groups
- Robust fallback system if assets unavailable
- Console logging for debugging asset import process

#### üîß **CURRENT WORKFLOW STATUS:**
1. ‚úÖ **Align Cylinders** - Working perfectly
2. ‚úÖ **Unwrap to Flat** - Creates proper flat grids  
3. ‚úÖ **Create Heightmaps** - Generates raster images with materials
4. ‚úÖ **Setup Geometry Nodes** - Imports and applies modular assets
5. ‚úÖ **Generate Terrain** - Live preview with real-time updates
6. ‚úÖ **Rewrap to Cylinders** - Creates final terrain (with undo option)

#### üéØ **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**

**Priority 1: Seam Awareness (Hard)**
- **Problem:** Heightmaps created per-object cause visible seams between segments
- **Impact:** Breaks terrain continuity across O'Neill cylinder sections
- **Solution:** Unified heightmap system with smart UV subdivision per object

**Priority 2: Interior Surface Detection (Hard)**  
- **Problem:** Terrain applies to all surfaces instead of interior only
- **Impact:** Ruins O'Neill cylinder habitat realism
- **Solution:** Detect interior faces and apply displacement selectively

#### üöÄ **NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASE:**

**v2.1 Goals:**
- [ ] Unified heightmap system across multiple cylinder objects
- [ ] Interior surface detection for selective terrain application
- [ ] Enhanced testing with real O'Neill cylinder geometry

**v2.2+ Future:**
- [ ] Multiple geometry node asset types (erosion, vegetation, weather)
- [ ] Advanced biome system for different cylinder sections
- [ ] Export pipeline optimization for game engine integration

#### üìä **Project Health:**
- **Asset Pipeline:** ‚úÖ Working and modular
- **Core Workflow:** ‚úÖ Complete end-to-end functionality

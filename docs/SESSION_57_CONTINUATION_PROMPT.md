## üéØ **SESSION 57 OBJECTIVES**

### **PRIMARY GOAL: UNIFIED CANVAS VALIDATION**
**Test the complete paint-to-terrain workflow and verify seamless terrain generation**

**Success Metric**: Paint continuous stroke across canvas ‚Üí seamless terrain spans multiple flat objects without pattern repetition

---

## üìã **SESSION 57 TESTING PROTOCOL**

### **PHASE 1: BASIC FUNCTIONALITY TEST** ‚≠ê **START HERE**

#### **Test 1.1: Horizontal Continuity**
1. **Paint horizontal stroke** across entire canvas width
2. **Verify seamless terrain** - should span all 12 objects continuously
3. **Check transitions** - terrain should flow naturally between adjacent objects
4. **Document results** - screenshot showing terrain continuity

#### **Test 1.2: Vertical Coverage**
1. **Paint vertical strokes** at different canvas positions
2. **Verify correct mapping** - left stroke affects leftmost objects, right stroke affects rightmost
3. **Check precision** - painted area should correspond to correct object
4. **Document correspondence** - canvas position ‚Üí object terrain mapping

#### **Test 1.3: Pattern Uniqueness**
1. **Paint complex pattern** with varying shapes and sizes
2. **Verify no repetition** - each object should show unique portion of pattern
3. **Check seamless joins** - pattern elements should connect between objects
4. **Document pattern flow** - continuous design across object boundaries

### **PHASE 2: BIOME COLOR TESTING**

#### **Test 2.1: Multiple Biome Colors**
1. **Paint with different biome colors**:
   - Gray (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) - Mountains
   - Blue (0.1, 0.3, 0.8) - Ocean  
   - Cyan (0.2, 0.8, 0.9) - Archipelago
   - Green (0.4, 0.8, 0.3) - Hills
2. **Verify terrain variety** - different colors should create different terrain types
3. **Test color transitions** - gradual color changes should create smooth terrain transitions

#### **Test 2.2: Mixed Biome Regions**
1. **Create mixed biome areas** with color gradients
2. **Test biome boundaries** - verify smooth transitions between biome types
3. **Check terrain coherence** - combined biomes should create realistic landscapes

### **PHASE 3: ADVANCED WORKFLOW TESTING**

#### **Test 3.1: Real-Time Performance**
1. **Test painting responsiveness** - terrain should update in real-time
2. **Check large area coverage** - paint substantial canvas areas
3. **Monitor performance** - ensure smooth operation with complex terrain
4. **Stress test** - rapid painting and terrain generation

#### **Test 3.2: Workflow Integration**
1. **Test complete workflow** - cylinders ‚Üí alignment ‚Üí unwrap ‚Üí heightmaps ‚Üí painting
2. **Verify repeatability** - process should work consistently with different object sets
3. **Check flexibility** - system should handle different numbers of objects

### **PHASE 4: ISSUE IDENTIFICATION & REFINEMENT**

#### **Known Potential Issues**
1. **UV seams** - check for visible breaks between objects
2. **Terrain scaling** - verify appropriate displacement magnitude
3. **Color sensitivity** - ensure reliable biome color detection
4. **Performance bottlenecks** - identify any slow operations

#### **Refinement Areas**
1. **Terrain strength** - adjust displacement intensity if needed
2. **Color ramp settings** - optimize terrain generation parameters
3. **Canvas resolution** - verify 2400x628 provides sufficient detail
4. **Real-time updates** - optimize for smooth painting experience

## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Issue: Terrain Not Appearing**
- **Check modifiers** - ensure Preview_Subdivision and Unified_Terrain applied
- **Verify canvas connection** - Image Texture node should have canvas assigned
- **Check UV mapping** - objects should have correct UV ranges

### **Issue: Pattern Repetition**
- **Re-verify UV fix** - each object should have unique U range
- **Check canvas sampling** - objects might be reading wrong canvas areas
- **Validate object sorting** - ensure correct spatial order

### **Issue: Discontinuous Terrain**
- **Check UV boundaries** - adjacent objects should have contiguous U ranges
- **Verify mesh topology** - ensure clean transitions between objects
- **Check modifier settings** - subdivision levels might need adjustment

### **Issue: Poor Performance**
- **Reduce subdivision** - lower Preview_Subdivision levels if needed
- **Canvas size** - consider smaller canvas for testing
- **Object count** - test with fewer objects first

## üìã Main Workflow Sequence

### **Step 1: Align Cylinders** üéØ
**Purpose:** Ensure all cylinder segments are perfectly aligned for seamless terrain
**When to use:** When you have multiple cylinder segments that need to connect

1. **Select all cylinder objects** you want to align
2. **Choose alignment axis** (usually X-axis for length-wise cylinders)
3. **Click "Align Cylinders"**
4. **Result:** All segments aligned along chosen axis

**Settings:**
- **Alignment Axis:** X/Y/Z axis selection
- **Precision Threshold:** Gap tolerance for alignment

---

### **Step 2: Unwrap to Flat** üìê
**Purpose:** Create flat grid objects that preserve the actual interior surface area
**When to use:** After alignment, before creating terrain

1. **Select aligned cylinder objects**
2. **Click "Unwrap to Flat"** 
3. **Choose subdivision levels** (4 is usually good)
4. **Result:** Flat grid objects created, originals hidden

**What happens:**
- Calculates exact cylinder dimensions (radius √ó circumference)
- Creates high-resolution flat grids
- Stores metadata for perfect reconstruction
- Original cylinders hidden but preserved

---

### **Step 3: Create Heightmaps** üñºÔ∏è
**Purpose:** Generate raster images for terrain painting or procedural generation
**When to use:** After unwrapping, before terrain editing

1. **Select unwrapped flat objects**
2. **Set heightmap resolution** (1024√ó1024 recommended)
3. **Click "Create Heightmaps"**
4. **Result:** Heightmap images created with proper materials

**Settings:**
- **Resolution:** 512√ó512 (fast) to 2048√ó2048 (detailed)
- **Automatic material setup** with UV mapping

---

### **Step 4: Edit/Generate Terrain** üèîÔ∏è
**Purpose:** Create terrain through manual painting or procedural generation
**When to use:** After heightmaps are created

#### **Option A: Manual Terrain Painting** (Recommended)
1. **Select flat object** with heightmap
2. **Click "Edit Heightmap"** 
   - Automatically opens Image Editor with correct file
   - Sets proper colorspace for editing
   - Switches to paint mode
3. **Paint your terrain** using Blender's brush tools
4. **Click "Return to 3D"** when finished
   - Returns to 3D viewport
   - Updates all heightmaps

#### **Option B: Procedural Generation**
1. **Select flat objects**
2. **Adjust settings:**
   - **Terrain Strength:** How pronounced the terrain is
   - **Noise Scale:** Size of terrain features  
   - **Random Seed:** For repeatable results
3. **Click "Generate Noise Terrain"**

#### **Option C: Advanced Archipelago Terrain**
1. **Click "Load Archipelago Assets"** (once per session)
2. **Select flat objects**
3. **Click "Apply Archipelago Terrain"**
4. **Result:** Advanced island/water patterns via geometry nodes

---

### **Step 5: Rewrap to Cylinders** üîÑ
**Purpose:** Convert terrain back to cylinder form with exact original dimensions
**When to use:** After terrain is completed

1. **Select flat objects** with terrain/heightmaps
2. **Click "Rewrap to Cylinders"**
3. **Set terrain scale** (2.0 is usually good)
4. **Result:** Terrain cylinders created with exact original positioning

**What happens:**
- Duplicates original cylinder geometry exactly
- Applies heightmap displacement to interior surface
- Preserves all transform properties
- Creates "_terrain" versions of objects

## üé® Heightmap Editing Tips

### **Image Editor Workflow**
- **Use "Edit Heightmap" button** - Automatically sets up everything correctly
- **Paint in grayscale** - White = raised terrain, Black = recessed, Gray = neutral
- **Use soft brushes** for natural terrain transitions
- **Save frequently** - Heightmaps are stored in the .blend file

### **Brush Settings**
- **Size:** Start with large brushes for major features, smaller for details
- **Strength:** 0.3-0.7 for subtle changes, higher for dramatic terrain
- **Falloff:** Smooth falloff for natural-looking terrain

### **Terrain Planning**
- **Start with major features** - Mountains, valleys, water areas
- **Add medium details** - Hills, ridges, river systems  
- **Finish with fine details** - Small terrain variations

## üîß Advanced Features

### **Archipelago Terrain System**
- **Load Assets:** Loads sophisticated geometry node groups
- **Island Patterns:** Creates realistic island/water distributions
- **Advanced Control:** More complex than basic noise generation
- **File Requirement:** Needs `/src/assets/geometry_nodes/archipelago_terrain_generator.blend`

### **Multiple Resolution Workflow**
1. **Start with 512√ó512** for quick iteration
2. **Move to 1024√ó1024** for detailed work
3. **Use 2048√ó2048** for final high-quality terrain

### **Batch Processing**
- **Process similar segments together** - Select multiple flat objects
- **Use same settings** for consistent terrain across segments
- **Handle special segments separately** - Central sea, taper zones, etc.

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **Enhanced Integrator Architecture**
```python
# Accessible via driver namespace
integrator = bpy.app.driver_namespace['canvas_terrain_integrator']
result = integrator.sync_canvas_to_3d_terrain()

# Enhanced biome detection
- Canvas region analysis (12 regions × 1024px each)
- Color tolerance matching for painted biomes
- Spatial mapping to corresponding flat objects
- Biome-specific terrain generation parameters
```

### **Real-Time Monitoring System**
```python
# Enhanced monitor function with 2-second updates
def enhanced_real_time_monitor():
    # Check system state
    # Perform enhanced sync with biome detection
    # Return 2.0 for 2-second intervals
    
# Timer registration for automatic monitoring
bpy.app.timers.register(enhanced_real_time_monitor, first_interval=2.0)
```

### **UI Integration Points**
- **Main Panel**: Enhanced controls in existing O'Neill workflow
- **Biome Guide**: Visual reference for painting colors
- **Status Indicators**: Real-time system monitoring

# Grid Integration Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Issue: Version 2.2.0 Syntax Errors

### **Error Summary:**
7 syntax errors detected in grid-integrated O'Neill terrain generator artifact, preventing load in Blender.

### **Specific Errors Identified:**

Line 3: "return" can be used only within a function
Line 5: Unindent amount does not match previous indent
Line 7: Unexpected indentation
Line 19: "return" can be used only within a function
Line 21: Unindent not expected
Line 95: Unindent amount does not match previous indent
Line 2142: Expected indented block

### **Root Cause:**
Artifact generation was cut off during "Continue" process, resulting in:
- Incomplete function definitions
- Orphaned return statements outside functions
- Corrupted indentation from multi-part assembly
- Missing closing brackets/blocks

### **Known Working Components:**
- âœ… Grid overlay GPU drawing system (tested individually)
- âœ… All operator classes (designed and validated)  
- âœ… UI panel integration (confirmed working approach)
- âœ… Scene properties system (standard Blender pattern)
- âœ… Auto-enable/disable logic (tested with painting mode)

### **Quick Fix Strategy:**
1. **Identify orphaned returns** - wrap in appropriate functions
2. **Fix indentation** - use consistent 4-space Python indentation
3. **Close missing blocks** - add missing closing brackets/colons
4. **Validate structure** - ensure all classes/functions properly defined

### **Testing Validation:**
Once syntax fixed, expected results:
- âœ… Add-on loads without errors
- âœ… "ðŸ“Š Show Grid" button appears in painting mode
- âœ… Grid overlay visible in Image Editor during terrain painting
- âœ… Orange boundary lines show between cylinder objects
- âœ… Biome color indicator appears in corner
- âœ… Grid settings dialog functional

### **Deployment Readiness:**
Grid overlay system is architecturally complete and ready for immediate deployment once syntax issues resolved.

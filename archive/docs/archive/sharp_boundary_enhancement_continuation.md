## 🚀 ENHANCEMENT TECHNICAL APPROACH

### **Sharp Boundary System Scaling**
```python
# Enhanced coverage implementation strategy
for obj in remaining_flat_objects:
    1. canvas_region = analyze_object_canvas_coverage(obj)
    2. if canvas_region.has_painted_areas:
        apply_sharp_boundary_system(obj)
    3. validate_pixel_perfect_boundaries(obj)
    4. measure_performance_impact()
```

### **VertexPrecision → SharpBoundary Upgrade**
```python
# Systematic upgrade process
for obj in vertex_precision_objects:
    1. clear_vertex_precision_modifiers(obj)
    2. apply_sharp_boundary_system(obj)  # Multi-biome capable
    3. validate_enhancement_quality(obj)
    4. compare_before_after_precision(obj)

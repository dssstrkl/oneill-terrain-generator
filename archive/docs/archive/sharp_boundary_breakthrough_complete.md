## 🛠️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Sharp Boundary System Architecture**
```python
# Core breakthrough - vertex-level canvas sampling
for vertex in mesh.vertices:
    world_pos = obj.matrix_world @ vertex.co
    canvas_x, canvas_y = world_to_canvas_coordinates(world_pos.x, world_pos.y)
    biome = sample_canvas_pixel(canvas_pixels, canvas_x, canvas_y)
    
    # Assign vertex to biome vertex group for sharp boundaries
    if biome != 'FLAT':
        vertex_groups[biome].add([vertex.index], 1.0, 'ADD')

# Apply vertex-group-constrained displacement for sharp boundaries
for biome in significant_biomes:
    displacement_mod = obj.modifiers.new(f"SharpBoundary_{biome}", 'DISPLACE')
    displacement_mod.vertex_group = f"Biome_{biome}"  # SHARP CONSTRAINT
    displacement_mod.strength = biome_settings[biome]['strength']
    displacement_mod.texture = create_biome_texture(biome)
```

### **Canvas-to-3D Coordinate Mapping**
```python
# Precise coordinate conversion for pixel-perfect boundaries
world_to_canvas_ratio = {
    'pixels_per_unit_x': 100.6,  # High precision mapping
    'pixels_per_unit_y': 108.6,
    'total_world_span': 24.0,    # World units
    'canvas_size': '2816x2048'   # Pixel resolution

## üéØ GEOMETRY NODES APPLICATION STRATEGY

### **Biome-Specific Terrain Implementation**:
```python
# TARGET IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
def apply_canvas_driven_terrain():
    """Apply 3D terrain based on accurate canvas biome assignments"""
    
    flat_objects = [obj for obj in bpy.data.objects if obj.get("oneill_flat")]
    
    for obj in flat_objects:
        canvas_biome = obj.get('canvas_biome', 'NEUTRAL')  # Already populated
        
        # Clear existing geometry nodes (clean slate)
        obj.modifiers.clear()
        
        # Apply subdivision first (confirmed working architecture)
        subdiv_mod = obj.modifiers.new(name="Terrain_Subdivision", type='SUBSURF')
        subdiv_mod.levels = 3
        subdiv_mod.render_levels = 2
        
        # Apply biome-specific geometry nodes
        geo_mod = obj.modifiers.new(name=f"Terrain_{canvas_biome}", type='NODES')
        
        if canvas_biome == 'MOUNTAINS':
            geo_mod.node_group = create_or_get_mountains_node_group()
        elif canvas_biome == 'ARCHIPELAGO':  
            geo_mod.node_group = create_or_get_archipelago_node_group()
        elif canvas_biome == 'OCEAN':
            geo_mod.node_group = create_or_get_ocean_node_group()
        elif canvas_biome == 'NEUTRAL':
            geo_mod.node_group = create_or_get_neutral_node_group()
        
        print(f"Applied {canvas_biome} terrain to {obj.name}")
        
    return True
```

### **Biome Node Group Creation Strategy**:
```python
# TARGET NODE GROUP IMPLEMENTATIONS:
def create_or_get_mountains_node_group():
    """Create dramatic mountain terrain with high peaks and valleys"""
    # High amplitude noise, multiple octaves, rocky displacement
    
def create_or_get_archipelago_node_group():
    """Create island-like terrain with gentle hills and coastal features"""
    # Medium amplitude, organic shapes, water-level cutoffs
    
def create_or_get_ocean_node_group():
    """Create water-like terrain with subtle waves"""
    # Low amplitude, smooth waves, blue-tinted materials
    
def create_or_get_neutral_node_group():
    """Create minimal terrain for unpainted areas"""
    # Very low amplitude, smooth surfaces, maintain flat characteristics
```

## üéØ GEOMETRY NODES APPLICATION STRATEGY

### **Implementation Approach**:
```python
# TARGET IMPLEMENTATION:
def apply_canvas_biome_terrain():
    flat_objects = [obj for obj in bpy.data.objects if obj.get("oneill_flat")]
    
    for obj in flat_objects:
        canvas_biome = obj.get('canvas_biome', 'NEUTRAL')
        
        # Apply biome-specific geometry nodes
        if canvas_biome == 'MOUNTAINS':
            apply_mountains_geometry_nodes(obj)
        elif canvas_biome == 'ARCHIPELAGO':
            apply_archipelago_geometry_nodes(obj)
        elif canvas_biome == 'OCEAN':
            apply_ocean_geometry_nodes(obj)
        elif canvas_biome == 'NEUTRAL':
            apply_neutral_geometry_nodes(obj)
        
        print(f"{obj.name}: Applied {canvas_biome} terrain geometry")
```

### **Spatial Validation Testing**:
```python
# TARGET VALIDATION:
def validate_spatial_accuracy():
    # Test that painted canvas regions match 3D terrain locations
    # Left canvas areas should show terrain on left objects (Neg_06 to Neg_01)
    # Right canvas areas should show terrain on right objects (Pos_01 to Pos_06)
    # Center canvas areas should show terrain on center objects
    pass
```

## üõë RED-LINE CONVERSATION MONITORING

### **CRITICAL STOP CONDITION**
**When conversation capacity drops below 15%**:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** stop development work
2. **UPDATE** `docs/development_summary.txt` with geometry nodes application progress
3. **CREATE** new continuation prompt with specific terrain application status
4. **DOCUMENT** any user feedback on canvas-to-3D accuracy

### **Red-Line Documentation Requirements**
- Current state of geometry nodes application
- User validation on canvas pattern recognition in 3D
- Performance of terrain generation on high-resolution meshes
- Next immediate steps for Phase 4.6 completion

---

## üí° DEVELOPMENT APPROACH GUIDELINES

### **Canvas-to-3D Application Focus**
- **Use Existing Canvas Data**: Objects already have accurate canvas_biome assignments
- **Apply Appropriate Geometry**: Match geometry nodes to canvas biome assignments
- **Test Spatial Accuracy**: Verify painted patterns translate to correct 3D locations
- **Validate with User**: Confirm canvas patterns visible in 3D terrain

### **Technical Implementation**
- **DON'T rebuild** the coordinate mapping system (it's working perfectly)
- **DO apply** geometry nodes using the canvas biome data
- **FOCUS on** creating clear visual differences between biome terrains
- **VALIDATE** that painted canvas spatial distribution matches 3D terrain

### **Performance Considerations**
- Canvas coordinate mapping is optimized and working efficiently
- Geometry nodes application should leverage existing subdivision architecture
- Test performance with 90K+ vertex objects during terrain generation
- Ensure smooth real-time canvas updates for user experience
